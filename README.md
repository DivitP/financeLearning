# Financial Data Analysis and Machine Learning
This repository showcases a series of Python-based projects focused on applying data science and machine learning techniques to financial markets. It covers key stages of quantitative analysis, from data exploration and risk assessment to predictive modeling and time series forecasting.

## Key Areas
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning, wrangling, and preprocessing  
- Visual analysis of single/multi-asset portfolios (Time Plots, Scatter Plots, Correlation Heatmaps, Box Plot, Histogram) 
- Normality Tests (Shapiro-Wilk Test, Jarque Bera Test)

### Probability & Risk Profiling
- Modeling asset return distributions  
- Value-at-Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES) calculation, and Monte Carlo simulations for risk estimation

### Machine Learning for Regression
- Models: Simple & Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net  
- Use Case: Forecasting economic indicators (e.g., GDP growth)  
- Emphasis on model tuning, diagnostics, and regularization

### Machine Learning for Classification
- Algorithms: KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Boosting  
- Use Case: Market movement prediction, liquidity classification  
- Model evaluation: ROC curves, AUC, Confusion Matrix, Precision/Recall

### Time Series Forecasting
- ARIMA for trend forecasting; GARCH for volatility modeling  
- Focus on stationarity, autocorrelation, and residual diagnostics
  
### Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
- Asset clustering based on historical price behavior  
- Applications in portfolio diversification and pairs trading
